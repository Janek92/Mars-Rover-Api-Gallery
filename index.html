          In order to search for signs of past life and explore Mars in 2003
          were sent two rovers.<br />
          One of them was
          <strong>Spirit</strong>
          which mission was planned at 90 days. Finally Spirit outlasted on Mars
          over six years and found evidences that this planet was somewhen much
          more earth-like and helped scientists better understand Martian wind.
          In May 2009 Spirit stuck in soft soil at a site called "Troy" and
          after many months of testing NASA ended efforts to free the rover end
          on May 25, 2011 mission was closed.<br /><br />
          <strong>Opportunity</strong> is a Spirit twin rover sent in July 7,
          2003. The main goal of its mission was search signs of ancient water
          and as just like Spirit much more exceeded his 90-days mission plan to
          almost 15 years. The most important discoveries was that long ago at
          least one area of Mars stayed wet for an extended period and that
          conditions could have been suitable for sustaining microbial life. In
          result of Mars-wide dust storm its location was blanketed in June
          2018. <br /><br /><strong>Curiosity</strong> landed in Mars' Gale
          Crater of August 5, 2012. Since that day Curiosity's mission is still
          ongoing and its goal is to determine whether the Red Planet ever was
          habitable to microbial life.<br /><br /><strong
            >How to use interface :</strong
          ><br />Select one of three rovers, later chose type of date - sol is a
          martian day where 0 is day of landing and by chosing earth date,
          photos will be generated relative to the date on earth when they were
          made. At the end, type specific date or number of sol.<br /><strong
            >Note that... </strong
          >In the preview of each photo you will find information about the type
          of camera that took a specific one. Many photos have no artistic value
          and may not be interesting for you, however, the aim of this
          application was to provide a whole range of photos shared by NASA.
